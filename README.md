# Crytocurrency Analysis

This respository contains the analysis of price and network data related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I made the repository just for fun; no investment purposes nor advice intended here.

This project is on-going, not finished.

## How to use the repository

First, install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) and get required dependencies:
```bash
# Create your env, if you require a new one
# Install all necessary packages
```
## Contents

The folder `data/` contains all the raw data used for the anaylsis.
These data is not uploaded to the repository;
you need to contact me if you would like access to it.

Additionally, the repository contains the following files:
- `tools.py`: helper functions and classes for data processing
    - A
    - B
- `01_BitcoinAnalysis.ipnb`:
