    "In this notebook, I compute a **Markowitz portfolio optimization** for three selected cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XMR.\n",

    "The Markowitz portfolio optimization consists in performing a **Monte Carlo Simulation** in the portfolio allocation space (i.e., the ratio assigned to each of the selected assets) to obtain the return and volatility (variance) values of each simulated sample.\n",
    "The best allocation is the one with the highest Sharpe ratio, which is basically the risk adjusted return:\n",

    "$S = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}$, where\n",

    "- $R_p$: expected portfolio return\n",
    "- $R_f$: risk-free return: return we would have had if we had put our money in an investment such as savings account, EURIBOR, or treasury bonds that are considered to be risk free. In the EU, the EURIBOR is currently (Dec. 2021) -0.5%, i.e., one bank **pays** a fee of -0.5% when it lends money to another one\n",

    "Note that William Sharpe (Nobel laureate) originally presented the formula for **yearly returns**: *mean* daily returns and std. dev. of the whole year. However, we deal often with daily, weekly and monthly sampling series, thus the **Anualized Sharpe Ratio** is obtained by multiplying the Sharpe ratio with the following k constant:\n",
